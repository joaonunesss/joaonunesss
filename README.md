### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joao Nunes, I am currently  a student @42 Porto.
The pandemic has given me the perspective and motivation I needed to do something I've wanted to do for a long time: look for a career change. It was then that, at the age of 33, I finally took the step forward and was introduced to 42 Porto, a school without teachers that focuses not only on technical development, but also on so-called soft skills, interpersonal skills. I fell in love with the proposal and, after going through all the selection stages, I am currently immersed in C programming projects. The course reinforced my passion for coding and for solving challenges, and I believe that the area of technology is the right path for me, becoming the motivating challenge I've always sought in my life. Welcome!
